New &amp; Improved Dice Thrower

This new and improved Dice Thrower now works on a set of nine LEDs.
The LEDs light up in patterns similar to the pip on a real dice.
It still is set to a showing a random outcome from one to six but can be set to show one to nine.
It is currently set to autorefresh the throw every 2 (or so) seconds.

- Improvement: Have the dice thrower throw on the push of a button and only refresh on another push.
